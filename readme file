## 🚩 Phishing Indicators Found

### 1. Spoofed Email Address  
- The domain `@paypalsecurity.com` is **not legitimate**.
- Real PayPal emails come from `@paypal.com`.

### 2. Suspicious Link  
- Hovering over the link shows it points to:  
  `http://restore-paypal-security.com/login`  
- Not an official PayPal URL → likely a phishing site.

### 3. Urgency and Threatening Language  
- “Account access suspended” and “permanent suspension in 12 hours”  
- Used to pressure the user into acting quickly.

### 4. Spelling and Grammar Errors  
- Sentences are awkward and unprofessional, such as:
  - “restore full access immediately”
  - “Failure to act in the next 12 hours”

### 5. Header Analysis Results (via MXToolbox)
- **SPF:** Fail  
- **DKIM:** Missing  
- **Reply-To:** Address differs from sender  
- Indicates potential **email spoofing** and misconfiguration
